# GraphQL in Android

This is a sample Android project that demonstrates the usage of GraphQL within an Android application.

## Getting Started

To run this project with a local GraphQL server, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Server Repository

First, clone the [local server repository](https://github.com/MohiFayden/mock-graphql-server) that will be used with this project:

```
git clone git@github.com:MohiFayden/mock-graphql-server.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up and Run the Local Server

Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository and run the following command to start the server:

```
node index.js
```

> Note: You should have Node.js installed on your system to be able to run the server. You can download it from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 3: Running the Android Application

Once the server is up and running, you can run the Android application to see GraphQL in action.

- Open the Android project in Android Studio.
- Make sure you have an emulator or a physical device connected.
- Click the **Run** button to install and launch the app.
